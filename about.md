# Victor Fugazzotto
My name is Victor Fugazzotto. I am a programmer mainly working in C# right now. Currently I am studying at University, looking to get into game/sofware development as a profession.

I have been working with Unity since around June 2014 with the release of version 4.3 and the 2D workflow. I have many years of experience working with various languages such as C#, Python, Java, and C both professionally and in personal projects. Outside of coding and work I enjoy playing games and watching TV.
