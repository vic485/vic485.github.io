It's been a long time since I last posted anything on my website, so what all have I been doing that been taking up my time?

Though seriously, I've had a lot going on since my last actual post back in September. Did a lot of AWS work and learning for my job during the week, and school took a ton of time as well. Took some freelancing work moving a website over to wordpress and reworked a project of mine in a different language briefly. I'm also working on changing my website over to a less cluttered dark theme site. Slowly going to bring old posts over to this one. The old site will stay in a separate branch on the site's github repo.
